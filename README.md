# most-active-cookie
Quantcast most-active-cookie coding assignment.

This repository contains the main python file, most_active_cookie.py, and its .exe form, most_active_cookie.exe. I also have a unit testing file, 
cookies_tests.py that accesses additional test case csvs from the testing_cookies folder. The example csv is provided in the main directory so that
the example command line calls work.

The repository also includes build and .spec files and folders that were automatically generated when converting most_active_cookie.py to an .exe file.
